# HilltopAds Premium Publisher Request

## Message to Send:

Hi! I'm an approved HilltopAds publisher (Account ID: 329079) with a high-traffic adult content site currently receiving $0.50 CPM rates on popunder ads with anti-adblock integration. Based on your official documentation showing $7-10 CPM for premium publishers with quality traffic, I believe my account needs review for premium publisher status.

My site features curated adult video content with strong user engagement metrics, legitimate direct traffic from tier-1 countries, and full compliance with your policies. The popunder implementation is working perfectly with your anti-adblock script, generating consistent impressions from quality users. 

I can provide my website URL once you accept the invite - could you please review my account for reclassification to premium rates? I'm confident this is just a classification issue as my site meets all technical and quality standards for your premium CPM tiers.

Looking forward to your response and optimizing this partnership!
