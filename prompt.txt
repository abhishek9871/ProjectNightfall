Let's say that I have a playlist or an existing playlist and I Share the playlist link using the share button in a playlist that i have created or from the existing playlist and when I or some other user opens the share link in a new browser window whether incognito or a normal browser window then I observe that when the playlist opens and I or some other user clicks on the "+ Save to My Playlists" button then nothing happens as the playlist gets saved but the saved playlist doesn't have the videos inside the playlist and the videos inside that playlist do not get added for the user who has added the playlist using the share link from some other user. What do you think we should do about this? What are your thoughts?
