**Your deep research prompt is excellent and I like the way you are going with this but please read my observations and pointers that I have mentioned below and maybe then we can be in perefct sync and do this perefctly with zero errors and hallucinations in any thing. Please read each and every pointer, understand it, analyze it and then decide how you are going to apparoach this. The pointers and observations are as follows:** 

- We are doing deep research and deep reasoning as of July 28, 2025 and not January 2025 as you have mentioned in your prompt.



- Why do you think mentioning Jio network is neccessary. We did the Jio network thing by using cloudflare proxy redirection just for Indian Audiences. You mus realize that Jio is just an Indian network. Prior to fixing things for Jio, we were actually working with Airtel as well. We are targeting all Internet service providers from all regions in the entire globe and not just Indian internet and service providers. If we keep on mentioning Jio and things like that then the deep research tool will get confused. Be wise in such stuff. You have also consider the aspect that the way, Jio had blocked the CDN networks for mobile devices, similarly there might be other ISP networks or sim providers or internet providers that might be blocking such things that we even do not know of as of now. So, we have to conduct in depth research about all such things for the entire globe. This will not be just some one deep research prompt thing and will most probably be a back and forth thing with the deep research tool and the deep reasoning tool.



- The deep research tool has live internet access but the deep reasoning tool doesnt have the live internet access. The deep reasoning tool is going to conduct deep reasoning from the perspective of the promtp that you will give to it based on the deep research tool's response. So always keep this in mind and be super wise and intelligent.



- We have to ensure that the deep research tool and the deep reasoning tool doesnt give use vague things and actually give us something that aligns with out goals and our curret project status.



- If at some point you feel that the deep research tool or the deep reasoning tool has provided us with something vague, then you are at the liberty to create a prompt for the tools so that you can be assured that what they provided is indeed correct.



- This is going to be a comprehensive back and forth between the three tools, you, the deep research tool and the deep reasoning tool. My role is to just copy the prompts you will give to the deep research tool, then copy it's response and share it with you and then copy the promt that you will give for the deep reasoning tool and then sharing it's resposne with you for your audit and analysis.



- You have to also understand that the workflow can be anyhting that you seem is going to help us in the best way. For example, we can also use the deep reasoning tool to reason on the deep research tool's output and then ask the deep reasoning tool to give a prompt for the deep research tool. You have to be smart in understanding as to orchestrate the entire communication within these tools.


- Your prompt assumes the adult traffic networks that were provided in the previous plans to be the best for our case. But what if in the world, there exist even betetr things that will actually allow us to achive our revenue goals with much ease and perfection. We have to also ssume the possiblility that for ine region certain ad networks offer muych higher CPM rates and that ame ad network in some other region provides the worst CPM rates. So, we have to be open to the possibility that we have to do somehting that our website automatically displays the ad from the ad network that is offering the best CPM rates so that the region where a user is using our website from any region on Earth, we actually earn the highest and maximum CPM rates. W ehave to conduct deep research and deep reasoniong for this thing as well. This is just one aspect that I have thought of, there might be many such aspects as wel. So, we have to keep an open mind and do this entire thing in such a way that whatever we decide uon is something that brings us one step closer to me achiving my goal with 100% certainity.


- You currently think that this is just going to be one prompt for everything. You have to understand that the deep research andthe deep reasoning tools are ultimately AI tools and if they are tasked with too much information or too many queries at once then what they give us in return mught be vague. So, keep this in mind.
