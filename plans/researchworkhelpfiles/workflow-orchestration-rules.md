- **Usage Rules**:
  - Single-focus prompts only (avoid multi-topic queries)
  - Always specify current date (July 28, 2025)
  - Request specific, actionable data (not generic information)
  - Global perspective (avoid regional assumptions)

**3. Deep Reasoning Tool**

## üìã **WORKFLOW EXECUTION PRINCIPLES**

### **1. Single-Focus Research Principle**
- **Rule**: One research topic per prompt
- **Rationale**: Prevents vague responses, ensures precise data
- **Example**: Research ad networks separately from traffic acquisition

### **2. Complete Data Transfer Principle**
- **Rule**: Deep reasoning tool must receive ALL research data
- **Rationale**: No internet access means complete context required
- **Implementation**: Include full research results in reasoning prompts

### **3. Implementation-First Research Principle**
- **Rule**: Research must include complete technical implementation details, not just strategic insights
- **Rationale**: Prevents research gaps that interrupt implementation phase
- **Process**: Strategy Research ‚Üí Technical Implementation Research ‚Üí Reasoning ‚Üí Implementation
- **Critical**: Never move to next research phase without complete implementation data

### **4. Complete Phase Completion Principle**
- **Rule**: Each research phase must be 100% complete before moving to next phase
- **Rationale**: Incomplete research creates implementation delays and gaps
- **Approach**: Research Strategy ‚Üí Research Implementation ‚Üí Reason ‚Üí Validate ‚Üí Next Phase
- **Critical**: Verify all technical details, code examples, and edge cases are covered

### **5. Global Perspective Principle**
- **Rule**: Always consider global market, not regional limitations
- **Rationale**: Maximum CPM comes from Tier 1 countries globally
- **Implementation**: Avoid India-centric or regional assumptions

### **6. Zero-Assumption Principle**
- **Rule**: No assumptions about "best" solutions without research
- **Rationale**: Market conditions change, better options may exist
- **Approach**: Research all possibilities, validate with reasoning

### **7. Validation Loop Principle**
- **Rule**: Cross-check findings between research and reasoning
- **Rationale**: Ensures accuracy and identifies gaps
- **Process**: If responses seem vague, create validation prompts
