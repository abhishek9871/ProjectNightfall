# Dynamic Research Workflow

## Research Philosophy and Principles

### Foundational Research Approach
- **Research-First Mindset**: Treat research as a mandatory first step for any task involving technology decisions, API integrations, library selections, or implementation strategies to ensure recommendations are current as of execution date (July 26, 2025)
- **Real-Time Validation**: Always verify information against current sources to overcome training data limitations (cutoff ~Q4 2024) and ensure accuracy for rapidly evolving technologies
- **Multi-Source Verification**: Never rely on single-source information; cross-validate findings across multiple MCP tools to eliminate bias and reduce hallucination risks
- **Constraint-Aware Research**: Filter all research through user-defined constraints (budget, timeline, technical stack compatibility) before presenting recommendations
- **Context-Conscious Execution**: Manage token limits (~200K) through modular research summaries and strategic file-based knowledge storage

### Quality Standards
- **Accuracy Over Speed**: Prioritize thorough verification over quick responses
- **Transparency**: Always cite sources and note when information conflicts or cannot be verified
- **Actionability**: Research must directly inform implementation decisions with clear next steps
- **Constraint Compliance**: Every recommendation must align with project budget, timeline, and technical requirements

## MCP Server Synchronization Strategy

### Primary Research Tools (Priority Order)

- Recency filtering (day, week, month, year)
**Use Cases**:
- Technology trend analysis and current best practices
- Library/framework version compatibility research
- Security vulnerability and patch status verification
- Performance benchmarking and comparison studies

#### 2. Firecrawl (Structured Data Extraction)
**Role**: Deep content extraction and structured data analysis
**Tools**: `mcp_firecrawl_firecrawl_scrape`, `mcp_firecrawl_firecrawl_extract`, `mcp_firecrawl_firecrawl_deep_research`
**Strengths**:
- Clean markdown extraction from documentation sites
- Structured data extraction with schema validation
- Deep research capabilities with multi-page analysis
**Use Cases**:

### Fallback and Error Handling Strategy
- **Rate Limit Management**: Rotate between tools when limits are reached; document switches in research summary
- **Tool Failure Protocol**: If primary tool fails, immediately switch to secondary with equivalent capability
- **Quality Degradation Alerts**: Flag when fallback tools provide lower-quality results than primary choices
- **Cost Optimization**: Prefer free-tier tools when budget constraints apply; escalate to paid only when necessary

## Adaptive Research Workflow

### Phase 1: Research Initiation and Scoping

#### Trigger Conditions
Research is mandatory when tasks involve:
- Technology stack decisions or library selections
- API integrations or third-party service evaluations
- Performance optimization or scalability planning
- Security implementation or compliance requirements
- Budget-sensitive tool or service selections
- Implementation approaches for unfamiliar technologies

#### Query Formulation Protocol
```
Template: "[Technology/Tool] [specific requirement] [constraints] as of [current date]"
Example: "React state management libraries under $100/month with TypeScript support as of July 2025"
```

**Query Enhancement Strategies**:
- Include version numbers and compatibility requirements
- Specify budget constraints and licensing preferences
- Add performance, security, or scalability requirements
- Include timeline constraints for implementation
- Specify team size and expertise level considerations

### Phase 2: Multi-Tool Research Execution

#### Step 1: Primary Deep Research (Perplexity-MCP)
```
Execution Pattern:
1. Formulate comprehensive query with constraints
2. Use recency filter appropriate to technology lifecycle
3. Extract key findings, citations, and conflicting viewpoints
4. Document source quality and publication dates
```

#### Step 2: Structured Data Extraction (Firecrawl)
```
Execution Pattern:
1. Identify key documentation or specification URLs from Step 1
2. Extract detailed technical specifications and requirements
3. Analyze integration complexity and implementation examples
4. Document API changes, deprecations, or breaking changes
```

#### Step 3: Contextual Analysis (Tavily)
```
Execution Pattern:
1. Research community adoption and real-world usage patterns
2. Extract implementation examples and best practices
3. Analyze user feedback and common issues
4. Identify potential risks or limitations
```

#### Step 4: Verification and Validation (Serper-Search)
```
Execution Pattern:
1. Cross-verify key findings from previous steps
2. Check for recent news, updates, or security issues
3. Validate pricing information and licensing terms
4. Confirm compatibility with existing project stack
```

### Phase 3: Synthesis and Documentation

#### Research Summary Structure
Create file: `research-summary-[task-description]-[date].md`

```markdown

- **Cross-Reference System**: Link related research files for comprehensive understanding
- **Version Control**: Update research files when new information becomes available
- **Thread Continuity**: Reference specific research files in new conversations to maintain context

#### Integration with Development Tasks
1. **Pre-Implementation Review**: Always reference relevant research summaries before coding
2. **Constraint Validation**: Verify implementation choices against research-documented constraints
3. **Quality Assurance**: Use research findings to inform testing strategies and edge cases
4. **Documentation Updates**: Incorporate research insights into project documentation

## Edge Case Handling Protocols

### Conflicting Data Resolution
**Priority Framework**:
1. **Recency**: More recent sources take precedence for rapidly evolving technologies
2. **Authority**: Official documentation and vendor sources over third-party opinions
3. **Consensus**: Multiple independent sources agreeing over single-source claims
4. **Verification**: Cross-verified information over unverified claims

**Resolution Process**:
1. Document all conflicting viewpoints with sources and dates
2. Attempt additional research with more specific queries
3. If unresolvable, present options to user with risk assessment
4. Flag for follow-up research if time-sensitive

### Rate Limits and Tool Failures
**Immediate Response Protocol**:
1. **Tool Rotation**: Switch to alternative MCP server with similar capabilities
2. **Query Modification**: Adjust search terms to work within tool limitations
3. **Caching Strategy**: Store partial results to avoid re-research
4. **User Notification**: Inform user of tool limitations and alternative approaches

**Fallback Hierarchy**:
- Perplexity → Tavily → Serper (for general research)
- Firecrawl → Tavily Extract → Manual scraping (for content extraction)
- Paid tools → Free alternatives (for budget constraints)

### Budget and Timeline Constraints
**Cost-Conscious Research**:
- Always include free and open-source alternatives in research
- Document total cost of ownership, not just initial costs
- Consider team expertise and learning curve in timeline estimates
- Flag when budget constraints may compromise quality or security

**Timeline Optimization**:
- Prioritize research based on implementation dependencies
- Identify parallel research tracks to optimize time
- Document quick-win alternatives for tight deadlines
- Balance thoroughness with delivery requirements

### Large Output Management
**Context Window Optimization**:
- Chunk large research into multiple focused files
- Use executive summaries for quick reference
- Create index files linking related research topics
- Implement progressive disclosure (summary → details → sources)

**Multi-Thread Continuity**:
- Reference specific research files by name in new conversations
- Maintain research file naming conventions for easy discovery
- Update research summaries rather than creating duplicates
- Use file modification dates to track research currency
