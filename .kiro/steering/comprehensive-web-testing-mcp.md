# Comprehensive Web Testing with MCP Servers

## Core Testing Philosophy

### Systematic Multi-Server Approach
- **Layered Testing Strategy**: Each MCP server serves a distinct role in comprehensive QA
- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple testing perspectives ensure no critical issues escape detection
- **Real-World Simulation**: Testing must mirror actual user behavior across diverse environments
- **Continuous Validation**: Testing is an ongoing process, not a one-time checkpoint

### Quality Standards
- **Zero Tolerance for Critical Issues**: Security, functionality, and accessibility failures are unacceptable
- **Performance First**: Every interaction must meet modern web performance standards
- **Mobile-First Validation**: Mobile experience takes priority in responsive testing
- **Cross-Browser Consistency**: Functionality must work identically across all supported browsers
