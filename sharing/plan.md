# Design Document

## Overview

The video sharing functionality will be implemented as a comprehensive system that enables users to share video content across multiple platforms while maximizing SEO benefits and user engagement. The design focuses on clinical precision with minimal disruption to existing code, utilizing modern web APIs, optimized meta tags, and platform-specific sharing strategies.

The system will consist of a reusable ShareButton component, a ShareModal for platform selection, dynamic Open Graph meta tag generation, analytics tracking, and mobile-optimized sharing capabilities. All components will be designed to work seamlessly with the existing React/TypeScript architecture.

## Architecture

### Component Architecture

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[VideoCard] --> B[ShareButton]
    B --> C[ShareModal]
    C --> D[PlatformShareButton]
    C --> E[CopyLinkButton]
    C --> F[NativeShareButton]
    
    G[ShareService] --> H[MetaTagGenerator]
    G --> I[AnalyticsTracker]
    G --> J[URLBuilder]
    
    K[ShareProvider] --> G
    K --> L[ShareContext]
    
    M[SEOHead] --> N[DynamicMetaTags]
    N --> O[OpenGraphTags]
    N --> P[TwitterCardTags]
    N --> Q[VideoStructuredData]
```

### Data Flow

1. User clicks share button on VideoCard
2. ShareButton triggers ShareModal with video data
3. ShareModal presents platform options and copy link functionality
4. Platform selection triggers ShareService methods
5. ShareService generates optimized URLs and meta content
6. Analytics tracking records sharing events
7. Platform-specific sharing interfaces open with pre-populated content

## Components and Interfaces

### ShareButton Component

```typescript
interface ShareButtonProps {
  video: Video;
  size?: 'sm' | 'md' | 'lg';
  variant?: 'icon' | 'button' | 'floating';
  className?: string;
  showTooltip?: boolean;
}
```

A minimal, unobtrusive button that integrates into existing VideoCard components. Supports multiple sizes and variants to fit different UI contexts.

### ShareModal Component

```typescript
interface ShareModalProps {
  isOpen: boolean;
  onClose: () => void;
  video: Video;
  shareUrl: string;
}

interface SharePlatform {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  icon: React.ComponentType;
  color: string;
  shareUrl: (url: string, title: string, description: string) => string;
  isNativeSupported: boolean;
}
```

A responsive modal that presents sharing options including:
- Major social platforms (Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Reddit)
- Messaging platforms (WhatsApp, Telegram)
- Copy link functionality
- Native Web Share API when available

### ShareService

```typescript
interface ShareService {
  generateShareUrl(videoId: number, platform?: string): string;
  generateMetaTags(video: Video): OpenGraphTags;
  trackShareEvent(videoId: number, platform: string): void;
  copyToClipboard(text: string): Promise<boolean>;
  canUseNativeShare(): boolean;
  shareNatively(shareData: ShareData): Promise<void>;
}

interface OpenGraphTags {
  'og:title': string;
  'og:description': string;
  'og:image': string;
  'og:url': string;
  'og:type': 'video.other';
  'og:video': string;
  'og:video:width': string;
  'og:video:height': string;
  'og:site_name': string;
  'twitter:card': 'player';
  'twitter:title': string;
  'twitter:description': string;
  'twitter:image': string;
  'twitter:player': string;
}
```

### Dynamic Meta Tag System

The system will enhance the existing SEOHead component to dynamically generate platform-specific meta tags based on the current video being viewed. This ensures optimal sharing previews across all platforms.

```typescript
interface VideoMetaData {
  title: string;
  description: string;
  thumbnailUrl: string;
  videoUrl: string;
  duration: string;
  category: string;
  rating: number;
  uploadDate: string;
}
```

## Data Models

### Share Analytics Model

```typescript
interface ShareEvent {
  id: string;
  videoId: number;
  platform: string;
  timestamp: Date;
  userAgent: string;
  referrer?: string;
  sessionId: string;
}

interface ShareMetrics {
  videoId: number;
  totalShares: number;
  platformBreakdown: Record<string, number>;
  clickThroughRate: number;
  conversionRate: number;
  lastShared: Date;
}
```

### Platform Configuration

```typescript
interface PlatformConfig {
  facebook: {
    appId?: string;
    shareUrl: string;
    requiredParams: string[];
  };
  twitter: {
    shareUrl: string;
    maxTitleLength: number;
    hashtagSupport: boolean;
  };
  linkedin: {
    shareUrl: string;
    requiresDescription: boolean;
  };
  whatsapp: {
    shareUrl: string;
    mobileOnly: boolean;
  };
}
```

## Error Handling

### Share Failure Recovery

1. **Native Share API Failures**: Fallback to custom modal with platform buttons
2. **Clipboard API Failures**: Fallback to text selection and manual copy instruction
3. **Platform Sharing Failures**: Show error message with alternative sharing options
4. **Network Failures**: Cache share URLs and retry mechanism

### Content Compliance

1. **Adult Content Filtering**: Use appropriate, non-explicit preview images for social sharing
2. **Platform Policy Compliance**: Implement platform-specific content filtering
3. **Age Verification**: Ensure shared links maintain age gate functionality
4. **Content Warnings**: Add appropriate content warnings to shared descriptions
