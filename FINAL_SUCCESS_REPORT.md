3. **Removed duplicate og:site_name from components**
4. **React Helmet is now the single source of truth**

### ✅ Video-Specific Tags Working
- Watch pages have `og:type="video.other"`
- Twitter Player Cards functioning
- Video embed URLs present

### ✅ Pagination Tags Working
- Category pages have proper `rel="next"` links
- Canonical URLs are page-specific

## Verification Proof

```javascript
// Homepage - ALL SINGLE TAGS
canonical: { count: 1 }
description: { count: 1 }
robots: { count: 1 }
ogUrl: { count: 1 }
ogSiteName: { count: 1 }
ogTitle: { count: 1 }

// Watch Page - PERFECT VIDEO TAGS
ogType: { count: 1, values: ["video.other"] }
ogVideo: { count: 1 }
twitterCard: { count: 1, values: ["player"] }
```

## SEO Impact
