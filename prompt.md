**You are to act as a code auditor and audit everything as to what was done and then tell me if the issues that I was facing before will now not be observed anymore or will they be observed even now. The code has not been deployed to production as of now and your analysis is super crucial in deciding as to what do we do now**


- Your diagnosis of the issue is present in the @diagnosis.md  file.


- To find out information as to what I shall do, I used a deep research tool and based on the findings present in the deep reseach tool's response, I got to aplan which focused on fixing these issues and that plan is present in the @IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md  and the deep research findings/response that I obtained from the deep research tool based on which this implementation plan was obtained is present in the @response.md  file.


- Now, the AI tool which is used to implement the plan given in the @IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md  file did it's work but considering the @IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md  had some stuff which was inaccurate such as the vite stuff which had to be corrected by the AI tool, the AI tool had to correct that stuff and then it did some things. To tell you what I am taking about and the conversation history with the AI tool, i copied the entire conversation and pasted the conversation in the file @tillnow.md . This file will tell you what was done and where and where the tool stopped beacuse of the quota error in the tool. The file contains things that it did and using this you can gauge as to what was done and what was implemented.

Title: SEO Verification on Production for Home, Category, and Watch Pages (Project Nightfall)

Goal
Run an automated SEO verification against the production site https://project-nightfall.pages.dev/ to ensure canonical, Open Graph, Twitter, and related meta tags are correct and not duplicated on:
- Homepage
- Category pages (including a paginated example)
- Watch pages

Tools and method
- Use Playwright MCP to:
  - Navigate to target URLs
  - Inspect document.head for canonical, Open Graph, Twitter, robots, pagination, JSON-LD tags
  - Capture the values and counts of tags, and flag duplicates
  - Optionally capture page.content() or raw HTML to confirm tags exist in prerendered HTML (before hydration)
- Produce a concise, structured report with PASS/FAIL per check and actionable recommendations for any issues

Pages to test
- Homepage:
  - https://project-nightfall.pages.dev/
- Category pages:
  - https://project-nightfall.pages.dev/category/milf
  - https://project-nightfall.pages.dev/category/milf?page=2 (pagination check)
- Watch pages (at least 3):
  - https://project-nightfall.pages.dev/watch/1
  - https://project-nightfall.pages.dev/watch/2
  - https://project-nightfall.pages.dev/watch/86

Checks per page type

General (all pages)
- Exactly one canonical link tag present
- Canonical is absolute HTTPS and matches site’s canonical style (consistency on trailing slash)
- Exactly one og:url tag present; og:url equals canonical
- Exactly one meta name="description"
- Title present and non-empty
- meta name="robots" is index,follow (or at least not noindex)
- No duplicate meta tags for the same property/name
- HTTP status code is 200
- Confirm tags are present in prerendered HTML (before hydration)

Homepage
- og:site_name present
- Twitter Card present (e.g., summary or summary_large_image)
- Optional JSON-LD: WebSite and/or Organization

Category pages
- Canonical points to the canonical category URL
- If paginated (page > 1), verify presence and correctness of link rel="prev" and rel="next" (when applicable)
- og:title and og:description match visible content intent
- Twitter Card present
- Optional JSON-LD: BreadcrumbList or CollectionPage (if present, verify)

Watch pages
- Canonical points to the canonical watch URL
- og:type = video.other
- og:video (and secure URL if available)
- og:image + width/height if provided
- Twitter Card = player (expected)
- JSON-LD: VideoObject present with key properties (name, description, uploadDate, duration, thumbnailUrl, embedUrl/contentUrl)
- BreadcrumbList JSON-LD (if present) has correct structure and positions

How to collect data (example Playwright snippets)
- Navigate and evaluate head tags
```js
await page.goto('https://project-nightfall.pages.dev/category/milf', { waitUntil: 'domcontentloaded' });
const result = await page.evaluate(() => {
  const head = document.head;
  const getAll = (sel, attr) => [...head.querySelectorAll(sel)].map(el => el.getAttribute(attr));
  return {
    url: location.href,
    title: document.title,
    desc: head.querySelector('meta[name="description"]')?.getAttribute('content') || null,
    robots: head.querySelector('meta[name="robots"]')?.getAttribute('content') || null,
    canonicals: getAll('link[rel="canonical"]', 'href'),
    ogUrls: getAll('meta[property="og:url"]', 'content'),
    ogTypes: getAll('meta[property="og:type"]', 'content'),
    ogTitles: getAll('meta[property="og:title"]', 'content'),
    ogDescs: getAll('meta[property="og:description"]', 'content'),
    twitterCards: getAll('meta[name="twitter:card"]', 'content'),
    prevLinks: getAll('link[rel="prev"]', 'href'),
    nextLinks: getAll('link[rel="next"]', 'href'),
    jsonLd: [...head.querySelectorAll('script[type="application/ld+json"]')].map(s => s.textContent?.trim() || '')
  };
});
```

- Optional: confirm prerendered tags are present in initial HTML
```js
const html = await page.content();
// Check that <link rel="canonical"> and <meta property="og:url"> appear before React hydration scripts if possible.
```

Report format
- Provide a section for each page tested with a checklist and PASS/FAIL per item, including:
  - Canonical (value and count)
  - og:url (value and count)
  - Description (value; count = 1)
  - Title (value)
  - Robots (value)
  - Pagination prev/next (category pages)
  - Open Graph/Twitter (presence and key values)
  - JSON-LD (types present, key fields; note validation concerns if any)
  - Raw HTML pre-hydration presence (Yes/No)
  - HTTP status code
- Provide a final summary with:
  - Overall PASS/FAIL per page type
  - Duplicates or inconsistencies found (e.g., multiple og:url on category pages)
  - Recommended fixes (actionable and minimal)
  - Priority of fixes (high/medium/low)

Acceptance criteria
- No duplicate canonical tags anywhere
- No duplicate og:url; og:url must equal canonical
- Canonicals are absolute HTTPS and consistent in trailing slash usage across site
- Watch pages expose correct video OG/Twitter tags and valid VideoObject JSON-LD
- Category pages include correct canonical and pagination prev/next where applicable
- All pages return 200 and expose SEO tags in prerendered HTML

Deliverables
- A single “SEO Verification Report” with the structure above, including concrete tag values and counts per page, issues list, and recommendations.
