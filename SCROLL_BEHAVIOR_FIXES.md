# Scroll Behavior Fixes - Top Rated Page ✅

## 🎯 Issues Fixed

### ✅ Issue 1: Page Navigation Scroll Position
**Problem**: When navigating from Home/Featured page (after scrolling down) to Top Rated page, the Top Rated page would load at the same scroll position instead of starting at the top.

**Solution**: Added a `useEffect` hook that runs only on component mount to automatically scroll to the top:

```typescript
// Scroll to top when component first mounts (Issue 1 fix)
useEffect(() => {
    window.scrollTo({ top: 0, behavior: 'smooth' });
}, []); // Empty dependency array means this runs only on mount
```

### ✅ Issue 2: Pagination Scroll Behavior
**Problem**: When clicking pagination buttons (next/previous/page numbers), the page would scroll to the very top, making users lose context of where the main video grid starts.

**Solution**: Implemented smart scrolling that takes users to the main video grid section (below "Recently Top Rated"):

```typescript
// Handle pagination change with smart scrolling
const handlePageChange = (page: number) => {
    onPageChange(page);
    
    // Scroll to main video grid (below Recently Top Rated section)
    setTimeout(() => {
        if (mainVideoGridRef.current) {
            mainVideoGridRef.current.scrollIntoView({ 
                behavior: 'smooth', 
                block: 'start' 
            });
        }
    }, 100);
};
```

## 🛠️ Implementation Details

### Added Components
1. **useRef Hook**: `const mainVideoGridRef = useRef<HTMLDivElement>(null);`
2. **Mount Effect**: Scroll to top when component first loads
3. **Smart Pagination Handler**: Custom function that scrolls to video grid
4. **Ref Target**: Added ref to the main video grid container

### Updated Components
1. **Pagination Component**: Now uses `handlePageChange` instead of direct `onPageChange`
2. **Time Filter Handler**: Also scrolls to main grid when filter changes
3. **Main Video Grid**: Wrapped in div with ref for scroll targeting

## 🎯 User Experience Improvements

### Before Fixes
- ❌ Top Rated page loaded at previous scroll position
